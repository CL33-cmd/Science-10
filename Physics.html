            <ul>

                <li>1 hour = 3600 seconds</li>
                <li>1 day = 24 hours</li>
                <li>24 hours = 86,400 seconds</li>
                <li>1 kg = 1000g</li>
                <li>1 cm = 10 mm</li>
                <li>1 km = 1000 m</li>

            </ul>

        <p><strong>Calculate displacement</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <li>displacement = final position - initial position</li>
                <li>up, right, north, east = positive</li>
                <li>down, left, south, west = negative</li>

            </ul>

        <p><strong>Calculate average speed, distance, and time</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <li>average speed = distance / time</li>
                <li>distance = speed * time</li>

        <p><strong>Determine slope of a position-time graph</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <li>slope = rise / run</li>
                <li>the slope represents the velocity, as it is the change in position over time</li>

            </ul>

        <p><strong>Determine type and direction of motion of different graphs</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <li>Position-time graphs:</li>
                    <ul>

                        <li>horizontal line indicates that the position of the object is not changing, and is therefore not moving</li>
                        <li>a curved shape indicated that the object is accelerating</li>

                    </ul>

                <li>Velocity-time graphs:</li>
                    <ul>

                        <li>a horizontal line at zero indicates that the object has zero velocity and is therefore not moving</li>
                        <li>a line with constant slope indicates that the velocity of the object is changing at a constant rate, and is therefore accelerating</li>
                        <li>a curve down means the object is moving in a negative direction, accelerates in negative direction, and speeds up (acceleration is in the same direction as movement</li>

                    </ul>

                <li>a line down means that the object is accelerating in the negative direction (decelerating, slowing down)</li>
                <li>a line up means the object is accelerating forwards (speeding up)</li>
                <li>speeds up = acceleration is in same direction as movement</li>

            </ul>

        <p><strong>Calculate average acceleration, final velocity, initial velocity, and time</strong></p>
            <ul>

                        <li>velocity = m/s</li>
